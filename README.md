CIVE202 Spring 2026 Group L Project#2 - Automation of Concrete Mix Design

In order to run the automated mix design jupyter workbook you need to download the .ipynb file labeled CIVE202_E_Spring_2026_GroupL_Project2(3).ipynb and run it with Jupyter note book or other Python module. 
In order to generate a Final concrete mix design a user must run all the cells in the workbook above the inputs cell for the calculations to function and save as varibles. If this step is skipped then the automated mix design will not function as intended. Once complete move down the jupyter workbook to the inputs section.

The first step the generate the Final Concrete Design is to input the project information and details into the cell labeled "Scenario Info (User Input)".
Once the User input is recorded, enter the Material Inputs in the next cell in the same order they are in the excel workbook.
When the inputs for the design specifics is completed and the workbook displays "All sequential inputs recorded successfully." you can then procede to running the design. 
With the inputs saved, run section 4.2 of the code to run the calculations.
Then the next step is to generate the Output Final Mix Designv by executing the data frame section of the code to generate a table displaying the Final Mix Design by component and its weight. 
This workbook is then repeatable and can be used for computing other mix designs by repeating the process starting at inputing the Scenario Info.
